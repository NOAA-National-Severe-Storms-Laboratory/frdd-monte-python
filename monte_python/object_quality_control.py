                          qc_params = [('min_area', 10)]. 
                Potential quality control
                 - 'min_area', removing objects below the minimum area (in number of pixels)
                 - 'merge_thresh', merging objects together closer than a minimum distance (in gridpoints)
                 - 'max_length', removing objects with a major axis length greater the given criterion (in gridpoints)
                 - 'min_time', removing objects with duration less than the given criterion (in time steps) 
                 - 'max_thresh', removing objects if the Pth percentile value is less than the given value. 
                                 For max, P=100 and min, P=0. For this quality control, use a nested tuple
